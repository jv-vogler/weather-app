Weather forecast for cities around the world.

### [**Live Page**](https://jv-vogler.github.io/weather-app/)

## Features
- Create cards with info about weather and local time.
- Alternate temperature scale (ºC / ºF).
- Alternate time format (24h / am pm).
- Alternate page language (pt-br / en).

## Tools utilized
- HTML

- pure JavaScript
- Webpack (transpile, minification, etc)

## About the project
An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app) with the goal of practicing APIs, Promises, async JavaScript and callbacks, however, I chose to go beyond the requirements and explore in practice topics like the MVC architecture.

Since this is an App without complex data I chose to use localStorage to store the cards and user settings preferences as it is more practical than something like IndexedDB.

### *Possible improvements:*
1. Favorite cards.
2. Utilize another API for search autocompletion.
3. Handle invalid querys (using a placeholder 'alert').
4. Loading animation during API calls.
